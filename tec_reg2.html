                The Rapid Fire Game is a fun and easy-to-play questions game that brings out the playerâ€™s inner self without putting in much effort.
                So, all you have to do in this game is to answer questions.
                All the participants can sit together and then everyone will ask questions to one player.
                The player is given no time to think and should answer the first thought that strikes their mind.
                Hence, you get unfiltered, funny answers.
                The answers also give you a peek into the true version of the answerer since the player has no time to filter the information or thoughts.
